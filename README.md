# Project Overview
This project is a machine learning model designed to predict marsquakes based on seismic activity data from CSV files that include velocity and time information. The model enhances detection of real seismic activities on Mars by reducing noise, making it easier for the model to accurately identify significant seismic events. Additionally, the project integrates a GPT-powered chatbot that allows users to interact with the dataset, ask questions, and receive comprehensive answers about the seismic activity.

# Features
Marsquake Prediction Model:
The core feature of the project is a machine learning model that predicts marsquakes by analyzing CSV files containing seismic data (velocity and time). By reducing noise in the data, we make real seismic events more distinguishable, which improves the accuracy of our predictions.

# GPT Chat Integration:
The project includes a GPT-powered chatbot that enables users to query the dataset directly. Users can ask questions such as:

"Can you give me the most dangerous seismic activity for the last 2 months?"
"Show me seismic activity for a specific date."
The chatbot responds with the requested data, including relevant tables and links to detailed information.

# Earth Conditions Simulation:
For each detected marsquake, we provide an approximation of what the seismic activity would feel like on Earth. This includes details like magnitude, pressure, and duration.

# Seismic Activity Overview:
Each seismic event in our dataset is linked to an overview page where users can explore the event in more detail. This includes visual representations, earth simulations, and additional metadata about the event.

# Usage
Data Input:
The project reads CSV files containing marsquake data. Each file includes columns for time, relative time, and velocity. These CSV files can be uploaded to the system, and the model will process the data to predict potential seismic activity.

# Model Training:
The machine learning model uses pre-processed and cleaned data, where noise is reduced to enhance the detection of significant marsquakes. The model can be retrained with new data to improve accuracy over time.

# Querying the GPT Chatbot:
Users can interact with the GPT chatbot by asking questions about the dataset. The chatbot will analyze the data and provide answers, along with tables and links to specific seismic events.

Example interaction:

User: "Can you give me the most dangerous seismic activity for the last 2 months?"
GPT: "Sure, here is the most dangerous seismic activity in the last 2 months:"

Seismic Activity Overview:
Each seismic event has its own overview page with additional details such as:

In Earth Conditions: The simulation of what this seismic activity would have been like on Earth.
Visual Representation: Charts and graphs showing the seismic data.
Event Summary: Detailed information about the event, such as magnitude, duration, depth, and pressure.
How to Run the Project
Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/marsquake-prediction.git
cd marsquake-prediction
```

Install dependencies:

```npm install```
Start the project:

```npm run dev```
Upload your CSV files with marsquake data via the web interface.

Interact with the GPT chatbot to explore the seismic activity data.

Data Format
The CSV files used for input should have the following format:

Time	Relative Time	Velocity
2022-04-09	00:00:05	1.2
2022-04-09	00:00:10	1.1
...	...	...
# Future Improvements
Additional Metrics: Incorporating more features like temperature and pressure during seismic events to enhance the model's predictive power.
User Feedback: Allowing users to flag events that seem significant or report false positives for further model training.
Real-Time Data: Integrating real-time marsquake data to enable live predictions and insights.
